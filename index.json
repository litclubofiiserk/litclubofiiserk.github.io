CreaƟve expression gives meaning to life. God is the creaƟve spirit in nature. But why? Mahler’s Music is very dear to me. Austere, sublime, grappling with pain and struggle and the ever blissful happy moments of life, of grandiose scale and structure, at moments going into the very abstract and the next moment very simple melodious terms of life. I believe that the key to salvaƟon is suffering, or at least the path starts from there. Or else how can one find, uniniƟated, that light within one? Imagine the darkest moments of life, when all there that is around you is death and decadence, when there seems but no path that escapes from the dark hell hole, in the face of deepest adversiƟes, it is then when the sublime light within one breaks like a new dawn. It is then that one can hear the songs of heaven, of eternal sunshine of the creaƟve spirit. The ability to experience is a giŌ of existence. The overpowering emoƟons shivering down your spine, floats you into a meditaƟve trance of eternal joy. But where does the path lead onwards from here? Do you fall back into the abyss or rise up like a Phoenix? But are these escapism into magic? I have no answer for that. Take Mahler’s IIIrd Mvt. From his First Symphony. As Mahler describes the movement in a conversaƟon with Bauer-Lechner in November 1900: \"On the surface one might imagine this scenario: A funeral procession passes by our hero, and the misery, the whole distress of the world, with its cuƫng contrasts and horrible irony, grasps him. The funeral march of \"Brother MarƟn\" one has to imagine as being played in a dull manner by a band of very bad musicians, as they usually follow such funeral processions. The roughness, gaiety, and banality of this world then appears in the sounds of some interfering Bohemian musicians, heard at the same Ɵme as the terribly painful lamentaƟon of the hero. It has a shocking effect in its sharp irony and inconsiderate polyphony, especially when we see the procession returning from the funeral (aŌer the beauƟful middle secƟon), and the funeral band starts to play the usual happy tune (which pierces here to the bone).\" In 1901 Mahler wrote in a leƩer to Bernhard Schuster: \"the third movement... is heart-rending, tragic irony and is to be understood as exposiƟon and preparaƟon for the sudden outburst in the final movement of despair of a deeply wounded and broken heart.\" ","date":"6 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blogs/submissions/5/","section":"Articles","summary":"","title":"Thoughts on Mahler's Music","type":"blogs"},{"content":" Pratyay Pal, 20MS The room has started shrinking. Alexi feared it long back. The ceiling was whispering for few weeks now. Recently the walls also had joined in the temptation of breaking all the cement bonds and let go all the burden of society that has been imposed on them without even asking their opinion for once! But all of these noises were somehow supressed by the monotonous sound of her laptop keyboard. Today it was different though, in that it seemed the room had bribed the laptop to stop waking up from the sleep no matter how hard Alexi tried.\nWith the distraction of the laptop and the work being gone, the whispering started increasing ever so slightly by each passing moment till it went to the verge of not being a whisper anymore. And a complete silence followed that. Alexi was lucky enough that she could break free out of that inhuman silence just in time, running out through the door straight onto the 13 1/2 Edison St.\nIn the hurry she forgot to glance at the clock. But the absence of any human being made it clear that it was well past midnight.“It’s awfully foggy tonight!” said Alexi to herself. The white street lamps made it look all the more surreal, as if some unknown substance has taken over the entire world without coming into anyone’s notice. Alexi kept on walking and the silence kept on following her trail. Street lamps and Trees alternatingly passed by and by the time she thought she should turn back, it wasn’t looking like the Edison St anymore. In fact, it wasn’t looking like anyplace she had gone before!\nFor 24 years now Alexi is living here, the address always starts with 13 Edison St. How can she not recognize this place? There was standing a really old tree by the side of the pavement. Both ends of the road ended in a milky white oblivion. It was as if the place stood frozen in time. Finally, she could get rid of the silence. It was the dew drops falling on the dry leaves of the big old tree. How many words can make up for these wise sound-drops she was imagining, when suddenly the sound of some footsteps started coming towards her from the back. She couldn’t see anyone, just the footsteps kept going on. Even through the fog one could see her face turning pale. She started running, running far from that old tree, from that street lamp, from the dew drops and the most fromthe footsteps. But after every few minutes the same old tree kept on showing up by the side of the same street lamp and the footsteps seemed to be closing on her ever so slightly.\nFew years has been passed since that foggy night. Alexi still uses the same keyboard to make that monotonous sound all day long. One cannot tell whether the walls still whisper or not. The footsteps are always going on, making the impression of catching her up in ever so near future. Nothing has changed in that room, except the fact that she doesn’t run from her past anymore.

Iris is someone’s grandmother, mother, sister and wife. But she’s slipping away. At the age of 91, she suffers from dementia and couldn’t recall most of the stuff. Tess and her grandmother Iris have a very strong relationship with each other and she wants to hold onto her as long as she can. When Iris’ health starts deteriorating, it comes upon Tess to look after her and arrange for homecare. However, Tess’ unplanned pregnancy is also something which she is finding hard to accept. Among all the chaos, she turns towards her mother, Donna for support who has been away almost for all her life. As their lives are intertwining, the friendship which blossoms between them helps both of them to move forward. As Tess struggles to deal with life alone, she meets another beautiful yet lonely soul, Gigi who resonates with her. As their stories are woven together, their support keeps the hope alive for a better future. While Gigi is struggling to get out of someone she doesn’t want to be anymore, Tess is trying to find herself. With a secret suitcase of letters which are a chain of conversation between Iris and someone called Tom, Tess tries to find out the missing pieces of her grandma’s life she never knew. Maybe this could give Tess the answer or the will to accept changes in her life. This book is all about people supporting each other, taking chances and finding happiness when you least expect it. Elizabeth Noble beautifully crafted this story where we see different relationships being born and certain encounters being life changing moments. In moments of darkness, the author always turns it to put a pinch of hope in the story. A wholesome book which will put tears and a smile on one’s face in the end.
